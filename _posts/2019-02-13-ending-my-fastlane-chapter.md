Iâ€™ve built and published iOS apps for over 8 years now. Back then the App Store review times were over 2 weeks, iTunes Connect would allow only uploads of a single screenshot at a time, there was no CocoaPods... and code signing was pretty much the same as it is today. 

In 2014, I sat in my dorm room and started working on a tool to solve some of the challenges I faced as an iOS developer. It started out by just automating the upload of screenshots and binaries to iTunes Connect. After publishing the initial version in November 2014, the iOS community seemed excited about it. It slowly went from just _deliver_, to more tools like _snapshot_ to generate the screenshots and _pem_ to automate iOS push notifications.

Fast-forward to today, I'm so humbled by what _fastlane_ has grown to be. It has changed the way large iOS teams work every day, how they release their app updates, and how code signing works. It even enabled founders to start new businesses using _fastlane_ as their core foundation.

I'm so proud to see how the community has grown around it. When _fastlane_ initially launched, it supported only 10 integrations. Today there are over 570 different integrations, from code coverage reports, beta testing services to build version management. All of this wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the [all the 922 contributors of the _fastlane_ main code base](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/graphs/contributors), all [the authors of the 355 third party plugins](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/available-plugins/), as well as the [fastlane core contributor team](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane#fastlane-team).

It was great to see _fastlane_ evolving from a small side project, into a stable, self-sustainable open source project with a strong community of contributors around it. I have no doubts that _fastlane_ will continue growing stronger in the next years, with the support of Google, as well as other companies and individual contributors.

**ðŸ“¯ After 4.5 years itâ€™s time for me to step away from _fastlane_, and with that leave Google.**

As for whatâ€™s next, I donâ€™t have any specific plans yet. Iâ€™ll be taking a vacation and then figuring out what problem Iâ€™m excited to solve next :)

### What does it mean for _fastlane_?

Google will keep investing in _fastlane_. There will be no changes to _fastlane_ and its support system. To get help with _fastlane_, [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/new/choose). At the same time, we will continue accepting [new fastlane core contributors](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CORE_CONTRIBUTOR.md), meaning you can get full push access to the _fastlane_ code base. 

### Thank you

Iâ€™d like to thank everyone from the Twitter Fabric, Firebase and Google Cloud teams for taking _fastlane_ where it is today. I'd like to specifically call out all the contributors and the iOS community for welcoming _fastlane_ and continuing to support it. In particular [Hemal](https://twitter.com/hemal) who believed in my vision and helped me grow personally and professionally.
