Today, whether your app is opened when your user is taking the bus to work, in bed about to go to sleep, or when out for drinks with friends, your product experience is the same. However, apps of the future will perfectly fit into the context of their users' environment.

As app usage has exploded over the past decade, personalization and user context are becoming increasingly important to grow and retain your userbase. ContextSDK enables you to create intelligent products that adapt to users' preferences and needs, all while preserving the user's privacy and battery life using only on-device processing.

ContextSDK leverages machine learning to make optimized suggestions when to upsell an in-app purchase, what type of ad and dynamic copy to display, or predict what a user is about to do in your app, and dynamically change the product flows to best fit their current situation.

Your users have different needs based on the context of what they are doing and where they are. Shouldn't your app be more personalized to better serve them?

ContextSDK takes hundreds of signals and builds a highly accurate and complex model, to correlate what a user is doing and the impact it has on in-app conversion events.

### ContextSDK performance

Meta has [published data](https://medium.com/@AnalyticsAtMeta/notifications-why-less-is-more-how-facebook-has-been-increasing-both-user-satisfaction-and-app-9463f7325e7d) on how "less is more" when it comes to notifications and user prompts: Even though in the short-term, just showing something on every possible occasion will increase your chances of the user engaging, in the long-run, you are better off showing fewer prompts, only when the user is most likely to convert.

**Context matters!** Large tech companies are already using those techniques to optimise their apps, and now is your chance to benefit from it as well. **[Sign up](https://contextsdk.com)** to get started.
