Since we are the winners of the European Botball Robotics competition, we took part at the Global Conference on Educational Robotics. This was our first year taking part at Botball.

The conference was in Honolulu, Hawaii.

After 5 exciting and interesting days we won the following awards:

* Outstanding On-Site presentation (100%)
* Outstanding Programming
* Spirit award
* Finalist

Next year I definitely want to take part in this awesome conference and competition as well. I talked with many smart and interesting students and mentors there
