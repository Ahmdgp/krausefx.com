<ul id="auxcord-list">
  <li>You host a party</li>
  <li>You play a playlist</li>
  <li>Friend wishes song</li>
  <li>You give them your phone</li>
  <li>Your playlist stops</li>
  <li>They change volume</li>
  <li>Song over</li>
  <li>Your playlist gone</li>
  <li>Party dead</li>
</ul>

### [Auxcord.org](https://auxcord.org) is a simple, free service:

Simply connect your Sonos and Spotify account, and manage your party in one spot:

<ul id="auxcord-features">
  <li>Never replace the currently playing song: always queue</li>
  <li>Your guests can use any phone to add songs</li>
  <li>Your guests don't need any account or login</li>
  <li>Disable the speaker's hardware buttons, so you control the volume and playlist</li>
  <li>Share a link or QR code ahead of time, so guests can pre-queue</li>
  <li>Prevent the same song from being played multiple times</li>
  <li>No need to hand over your phone, or have your friends spell the title of the song</li>
</ul>

Currently, [Auxcord](https://auxcord.org) works with Sonos & Spotify. The project is free to use, however not yet open source. Depending on demand, I might open source the repo on GitHub.

It's like a Jukebox, but for your Sonos & Spotify setup.

### Open [Auxcord.org](https://auxcord.org) here to start using it for your next party.
