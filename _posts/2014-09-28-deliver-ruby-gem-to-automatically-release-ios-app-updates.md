Updating your iOS app should not be painful and time consuming. Automate the whole process to start with Continuous Deployment.

Deliver 
**can upload ipa files, app screenshots and more to the iTunesConnect backend**
, which means, you can deploy new iPhone app updates just by using the command line.

# Features


* Upload hundreds of screenshots with different languages from different devices
* Upload a new ipa file to iTunesConnect without Xcode from any computer
* Update app metadata
* Easily implement a real Continuous Deployment process
* Store the configuration in git to easily deploy from  **any**
 computer, including your Continuous Integration server (e.g. Jenkins)

The project is fully open source, well documented and has a high test coverage.
