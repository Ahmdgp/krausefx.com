Recently I've been working on some really cool iOS related open source tools. All those run independently from each other. This changes with **fastlane.**

There is a really cool website about the project: [https://fastlane.tools](https://fastlane.tools)

With fastlane you define how your app needs to get released to the App Store (or beta testing service).

**Features:**

* Connect all tools, part of the fastlane toolchain to work seamlessly together
* Define different deployment lanes for App Store deployment, beta builds or testing
* Deploy from any computer
* [Jenkins Integration](https://github.com/krausefx/fastlane#jenkins-integration): Show the output directly in the Jenkins test results
* Write your [own actions](https://github.com/krausefx/fastlane#extensions) (extensions) to extend the functionality of fastlane
* Store data like the Bundle Identifier or your Apple ID once and use it across all tools
* Never remember any difficult commands, just fastlane
* Easy setup, which helps you getting up and running very fast
* Shared context, which is used to let the different deployment steps communicate with each other
* Store **everything** in git. Never lookup the used build commands in the Jenkins configs
* Saves you **hours** of preparing app submission, uploading screenshots and deploying the app for each update
* Very flexible configuration using a fully customizable Fastfile
* Once up and running, you have a fully working **Continuous Deployment** process. Just trigger fastlane and you're good to go.
