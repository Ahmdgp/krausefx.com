You probably know how time-consuming it is to ensure your app follows the latest app review guidelines. App store rules can be complicated and hard to remember because they are constantly changing, but all developers need to follow them to avoid rejection. 

 

That’s why today, we’re excited to introduce 
fastlane precheck to save you the time and hassle of auditing your own app! 
fastlane precheck reviews your app’s metadata (in seconds) to catch the most common metadata rejection errors, such as mentioning other platforms or having broken URLs.

 

On a personal note, I’m super thrilled to launch fastlane precheck because it’s the first new iOS tool we built 
[since joining Google](https://krausefx.com/blog/fastlane-is-joining-google).
