One of the most common activities when using a computer is switching between apps and their windows. Unfortunately macOS is optimised for casual computer users (Mission Control, using the mouse, etc.).

### Using the dock

This approach requires the mouse and wastes either screen space, or has a slow animation when using auto-hide.

### Using CMD + Tab

This approach is keyboard based, however the order of the application is sorted by most recently used, which is only nice to quickly switch between 2 applications.

Additionally this technique doesn't allow you to launch a new application, but only switch between running ones.

### Using Spotlight or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

Great to quickly launch any application, however it's not as fast as other approaches, as it requires you to type in multiple letters.


## New: Launch every application using a shortcut

When people watch me use my computer I get asked a lot how I can switch between my applications so quickly.

I'm not kidding, **I have a custom keyboard shortcut for every single application** I use frequently.

This way I can **always** switch to any application just using one keyboard shortcut.

I use the excellent tool called [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/), which was originally built to use custom gestures for the trackpad and mouse, however I use it mostly for my shortcuts. 

Using [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/), it will either switch to a running application or launch it otherwise.

Some tricks:

* ALT + [letter]: Open a specific application (e.g. ALT + n launches Notes)
* Alt + 2: Open the screenshots directory (use this for any directory you use often)
* Ctrl + CMD + Arrow: Move window to next monitor

For even faster switches, change the BTT trigger to use `"Trigger on Key Down"`.
