In the world of mobile app development, understanding the user is key to creating experiences that resonate and retain. Today, we're thrilled to introduce [Context Insights](https://contextsdk.com/insights), a brand new analytics tool designed from the ground up for iOS developers. Context Insights is your gateway to understanding the real-world contexts in which your users engage with your app.

## A New Dimension of User Understanding

iOS apps are used in a multitude of circumstances, at home on the couch, during the commute, while out on a walk, or anywhere in-between. Context Insights offers a new approach to user analytics. By analyzing the real-world context of your user base, you can gain insights into how different situations influence app usage. This allows you to segment your users more meaningfully, according to the context in which they interact with your app, providing a deeper understanding of their behavior and preferences.

## Unparalleled Ease of Integration

We know how precious development time is. That's why we've made integrating Context Insights into your iOS app as simple as possible. You’re just three steps away from getting brand new insights into how your app is used.

### Step 1 - Signup and get your license key

Head over to our [signup page](https://insights.contextsdk.com/register) and create a free account. We will send you your license key via email immediately.

### Step 2 - Download ContextSDK and integrate it into your app

Simply add ContextSDK as a dependency to your `Podfile` (other integration options are supported as well, see [here](https://docs.insights.contextsdk.com/#installation)) and activate it by adding a single line at app start:

```

### Step 3 - Ship an Update

After the super simple integration simply ship an update to the App Store and we will notify you as soon as your insights are ready.

## Designed with Performance in Mind

Context Insights is designed to ensure a negligible impact on your app’s performance. Adding less than 700KB to your app's footprint. Moreover, it operates using less than 1MB of memory while active, ensuring that your apps performance is unaffected.
