Together with [Orta Therox](https://twitter.com/orta), we created the open source project [danger](https://github.com/danger/danger) in 2015. It's a tool that helps you automate your code review process. It's a Ruby gem that runs on your CI server and can be used to automate common code review tasks. It's used by thousands of developers and has been a great success.

At this point, danger got re-written in various programming languages (JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin & Python), check out [danger.systems](https://danger.systems/) for a full overview.

I had to stop actively working on this project in 2016, as I've decided to spend more of time on [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane). To this day, [@orta](https://twitter.com/orta) is still driving the project, and built an active community around it.
