In the summer 2010 I developed a web app optimized for iPhone and Android phones to access all routes that are available at 
[http://bikemap.net](http://bikemap.net/)

After I finished this site, I started implementing a native app with Appcelerator Titanium.

The webapp even supported tracking and uploading new routes to Bikemap right from inside the browser.
