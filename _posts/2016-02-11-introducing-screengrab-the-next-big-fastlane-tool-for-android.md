Before fastlane became part of Twitter, fastlane was only available for iOS applications. This year, at 
[Twitter Flight](https://krausefx.com/blog/fastlane-is-now-part-of-fabric), we announced Android support for fastlane. We started by helping you ship your app to Google Play using 
[supply](https://github.com/fastlane/supply). Of course, we also integrated with the tools you already love, like Gradle.

Today, we’re excited to announce 
[screengrab](https://github.com/fastlane/screengrab), a new tool to automate taking localised screenshots on different Android devices. It’s similar to 
[snapshot](https://github.com/fastlane/snapshot), but for Android apps.

Check out the 
[Fabric Blog Post](https://fabric.io/blog/introducing-screengrab) for more information.
