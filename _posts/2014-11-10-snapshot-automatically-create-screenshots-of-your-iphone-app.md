### Create hundreds of screenshots of your iPhone app... 
while doing something else!


You have an iPhone app. You support 20 languages. You updated the design. You want to release the update to the App Store. 
What's missing?

**New Screenshots**

You want them to look 
**perfect**
 and 
**gorgeous**
. They should show the same screens on all devices in all languages.

You have to manually create 20 (languages) x 4 (devices) x 5 (screenshots) = 
**400 screenshots**
.

It's hard to get everything right!

* New screenshots with every (design) update
* No loading indicators
* Same content / screens
* A clean status bar
* Uploading screenshots ([deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver) is your friend)

This script helps you solve all those problems: Automatically switch languages and device types, properly export the resulting screenshots, etc.
