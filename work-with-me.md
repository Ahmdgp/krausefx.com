## _fastlane_ consulting

As the founder of [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) (and the only person with 8.5 years of _fastlane_ experience) I have in-depth knowledge of the tool itself, but most-importantly the entire mobile development ecosystem. 

I've worked with companies of every size, from startups to Fortune 500 companies, like Uber, Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter and Google to help them optimize their mobile development process.

It's not just about knowing _fastlane_ inside out - it's about truly understanding how mobile app development teams work and how to further improve their efficiency, and setting up a state of the art Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. 

As part of my work, I've also published [ios-factor.com](https://ios-factor.com), a set of best practices for iOS app development teams on how to build and ship high quality iOS apps.

I get invited to speak about this topic at [dozens of conferences](https://github.com/krausefx/speaking), like at the [Facebook Mobile@Scale Conference in Israel](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2164710343846256) or [at the MCE Conference in Poland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOtANfkh2bI), and as of mid April 2023 I'm available for contract work.
