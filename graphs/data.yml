  takeaways:
  - Tracking macros precisely is the best way to lose/gain weight at a controlled and healthy speed
  - When I first started tracking macros, additionally to already working out regularly, is when I saw by far the best results
  - It takes a lot of energy to be consistent, but it's worth it, and it will make you feel good (e.g. feeling good about using a spoon to eat plain Nutella if you have the macros left)
  - Gaining and losing weight is pretty much math, if you track your macros and weight, and you have almost full control over it

  - Generally, you can pretty much calculate your weight on a certain date, if you consistently track your meals, and correctly calculated your macros

  takeaways:
  - "Overall, the air quality in Vienna is excellent. Just opening the windows for a few minutes is enough to get a 100% air score"
  - "The smaller the room, the more difficult it is to keep the CO2 levels low"
  - "The only room where I'm still struggling to keep the CO2 levels low is my bedroom, which is small, and doesn't offer any ventilation. Keeping the doors open mostly solves the high CO2 levels, however comes with other downsides like more light"
  - "Probably obvious for many, but I didn't realize ACs don't transport any air into the room, but just moves it around"
  - "Opening the windows for a longer time in winter will cause low humidity and low temperatures, so it's often not a good option"

  - I have a graph that ensures I have the right target distribution of high, medium and low risk positions
  - Whenever I take on a potential new project/role, I simulate the various outcome scenarios over the next few years

  takeaways:
  - Not owning an apartment, and living in Airbnbs as a nomad I actually spent less money. This was due to not having to buy any furniture, appliances, etc. but also because the number of items I could by for myself was limited, as everything was limited to be able to fit into 2 suitcases.
  - Misc. subscriptions/expenses are adding up quickly
  - Having an End-Of-Year summary from your credit card provider, and always using your card when possible, is a great way to get those numbers
  - Creating this chart is still a lot of work, if you want to also consider getting reimbursed, or expenses you've covered for a group (e.g. booked a larger Airbnb)
